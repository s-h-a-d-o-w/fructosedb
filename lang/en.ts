  sourcesAbsoluteNumbers: `
The <strong>absolute</strong> content is measured based on what the {usdaIcon} 
declares to be the serving size (fructose should not exceed more than 
3g per meal). Which may not be based on average eating habits. E.g. 
who eats 1 cup of raisins in one sitting? Unfortunately, we don't have 
the staff to manually define reasonable serving sizes.`,
  sourcesDescription: `
Data is provided by the {usdaIcon} through their {usdaLink} and updated once a day. 
(Should new foods be added, translations will lag behind, as they are hand-crafted. 
Feel free to notify us of missing translations.)`,
  sourcesFormula: `
The formula for calculating whether it is recommended to avoid a given 
food or not was derived from the article {articleLink} 
by Dr. Janice Joneja and is a combination of <strong>relative</strong> 
and <strong>absolute</strong> fructose content. See also {wikipediaLink} 
for complementary sources.`,
  sourcesNote: `
<strong>NOTE</strong> Severity of issues from fructose consumption 
depend on quantity, time (to digest - so the time between consuming 
fructose) and varies from person to person. 
So the most important thing is not necessarily the fructose content of 
specific food but how much you eat of it during one meal. For 
instance, raisins are generally considered harmful but if your degree 
of malabsorption allows it, you may be fine sprinkling 10 pieces or so 
on top of a porridge that is mostly free of sugar otherwise. And if 
you eat no other sugar during this meal.`,
  sourcesRelativeNumbers: `
The <strong>relative</strong> content is derived from comparison with glucose. 
So related to the F/G ratio in the table. If fructose exceeds glucose 
by 0.5g, the food is not recommended. (Sucrose is factored into this)`,
