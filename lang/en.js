    sourcesAbsoluteNumbers: "\nThe <strong>absolute</strong> content is measured based on what the {usdaIcon} \ndeclares to be the serving size (fructose should not exceed more than \n3g per meal). Which may not be based on average eating habits. E.g. \nwho eats 1 cup of raisins in one sitting? Unfortunately, we don't have \nthe staff to manually define reasonable serving sizes.",
    sourcesDescription: "\nData is provided by the {usdaIcon} through their {usdaLink} and updated once a day. \n(Should new foods be added, translations will lag behind, as they are hand-crafted. \nFeel free to notify us of missing translations.)",
    sourcesFormula: "\nThe formula for calculating whether it is recommended to avoid a given \nfood or not was derived from the article {articleLink} \nby Dr. Janice Joneja and is a combination of <strong>relative</strong> \nand <strong>absolute</strong> fructose content. See also {wikipediaLink} \nfor complementary sources.",
    sourcesNote: "\n<strong>NOTE</strong> Severity of issues from fructose consumption \ndepend on quantity, time (to digest - so the time between consuming \nfructose) and varies from person to person. \nSo the most important thing is not necessarily the fructose content of \nspecific food but how much you eat of it during one meal. For \ninstance, raisins are generally considered harmful but if your degree \nof malabsorption allows it, you may be fine sprinkling 10 pieces or so \non top of a porridge that is mostly free of sugar otherwise. And if \nyou eat no other sugar during this meal.",
    sourcesRelativeNumbers: "\nThe <strong>relative</strong> content is derived from comparison with glucose. \nSo related to the F/G ratio in the table. If fructose exceeds glucose \nby 0.5g, the food is not recommended. (Sucrose is factored into this)"
